AI4MATH: Minicourse for Lean (IV) - More on Structures and Typical Proof Logic

## Abstract

In this lecture, we will continue our unfinished discussion on structures and typical proof logic. We will resume our journey to introduce more advanced techniques in recursion and induction. In addition to theorem proving, I will also talk about how can you design syntax and notations to make your formalization more readable and maintainable.

## Title

AI4MATH: Minicourse for Lean (IV) - Topics on the Practice of LLM Tools in Lean 4

## Abstract

In the previous sections, we have introduced some recent LLM tools in Lean 4, especially the ones for auto-formalization and auto-proving. In this lecture, I will show you the basic concepts and techniques behind these tools, and how you can use them to improve your efficiency in both formal and informal research. I will also try to introduce to you some recent progress in the field of LLM reasoning in mathematics.
